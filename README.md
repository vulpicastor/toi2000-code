# Code and data for the TOI-2000 discovery paper

This repository contains the Python Jupyter notebooks and data tables used in
the preparation of the paper titled "TESS spots a mini-neptune interior to a
hot saturn in the TOI-2000 system" by Sha et al. (2023).

The Python Jupyter notebooks can be found under the `src/` directory. They are
best run in an Anaconda environment recreated using the supplied
`environment.yml` file. See `BUILD.md` for more information.

The data tables can be found under the `data/` directory. See the `README.md`
file there for more instructions.
